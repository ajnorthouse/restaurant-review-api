<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a demonstrative project given to us by the JUMPlus program for us to demonstrate our skills with React, Spring Boot, AWS, and MySQL databases. The stated goal of the project was something akin to yelp, a sort of service where users can leave reviews on restaurants, admins can manage restaurants, and anyone can search the website for restaurants and information on them.

This is the back-end API of the project. It was built entirely inside a spring boot project with maven as a dependency management tool. It contains Spring Security elements, Spring Mock Testing, Spring JPA elements, to host the service up on an /api/ url.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  * Spring Security
  * Spring Testing
  * Spring JPA
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
